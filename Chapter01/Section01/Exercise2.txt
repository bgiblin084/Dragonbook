What are the advantages of (a) a compiler over an intepreter and (b) an
interpreter over a compiler?

Compilers allow for faster code execution, because at compile time we can
complete optimization. Interpreters have the advantage of more verbose output,
as have more control visibility into the execution at run time making for more
verbose and perhaps more usefull error outputs.
