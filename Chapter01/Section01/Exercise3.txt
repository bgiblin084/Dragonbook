What advantages are there to a language-processing system in whcih the
compiler produces assembly language rather than machine language?

This is useful for several reasons, 1) we can have some "division of labor".
We can allow a dedicated assembler to deal with the problems of expanding
assembly. 2) Assembly tends to be more useful to the programmer, as it is much
easier to debug then assembled machine code.
