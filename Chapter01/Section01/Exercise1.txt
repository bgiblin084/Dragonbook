What is the difference between a compiler and an interpreter?

The difference between a compiler and an interpreter is that a compiler
converts a source program into a target program immediately, at compile time. 
Conversely, an interpreter will execute a program line by line at run time,
allowing for more real time feedback from the interpreter as opposed to a
compiled program. A compiled program will typically have faster execution time
as the program has gone through layers of optimization.
