Consider the context-free grammar
S -> S S + | S S * | a

a) Show how the string aa+a* can be generated by this gramar
b) Construct a parse tree for this string
c) What language does this grammar generate? Justify your answer

a) (aa+) -> s, a -> s, ss* -> s
b)    S
    / | \
   S  S  *
  /|\  \
 S S +  a
 | |
 a a

c) This language represents postfix expressions. This is evident because
calculations are done in a left associative manner on digits using either the
plus operator or multiply operator.
