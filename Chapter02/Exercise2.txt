What language is generated by the following grammars? In each case justify
your answer.

a) S -> 0 S 1 | 0 1
b) S -> + S S | - S S | a
c) S -> S (S) S | î
d) S -> a S b S | b S a S | î
e) S -> a | S + S | S S | S * | (S)

a) {0^n1^n | n >= 1}
b) {prefix expressions made up of a digit with plus or minus operators}
c) the possibly empty set of all nested parenthesis arrangments. 
d) Not entirely certain for this one... Beyond saying that the number of 'a'
and 'b' should be equivelent (and can be 0)
e) This seems to be a subset of the regular expression grammar.
